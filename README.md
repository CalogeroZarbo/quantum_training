### QBoost & AWS Sagemaker - Managed Training & Serving of QML models
In the folder sagemaker-qboost you can find my example on how to run the QBoost algorithm on AWS SageMaker, in order to be
a fully managed service, and therefore production ready.
The tutorial is inspired by the work of D-Wave on the implementation of the [QBoost][qbst] algorithm, and by the official
tutorial of AWS SageMaker [Bring Your Own Algorithm][aws_sgmkr].
